The dataset used for this report analysis is curated from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
it contains records for 1884 respondents, each characterized by 12 distinct attributes such as level of education, age, gender, country of residence, ethnicity, and personality measurements. 
such as BIS-11 (impulsivity), ImpSS (sensation seeking), and NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness). 
Originally, each input attribute was quantified and categorical. Participants also answered questions about their use of 18 illicit and legal drugs 
(crack, cocaine, chocolate, cannabis, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, nicotine, mushrooms, and volatile substances), 
as well as one fictitious drug (Semeron), which was introduced to identify over-claimers.
